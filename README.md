### 3. Configure the Backend

1. **Update Database Credentials:**

   - Open the `db.php` file in the `assets/php` directory.
   - Update the database connection details with your MySQL credentials (default XAMPP credentials are used below):

     ```php
     $host = 'localhost';
     $dbname = 'employee_management';
     $username = 'root'; // Default XAMPP username
     $password = '';     // Default XAMPP password (empty)
     ```

2. **Place the Project in XAMPP's `htdocs` Folder:**
   - Move the project folder (`employee-management-system`) to the `htdocs` directory inside your XAMPP installation folder (e.g., `C:\xampp\htdocs`).

### 4. Access the Application

1. **Start XAMPP:**

   - Ensure the **Apache** and **MySQL** services are running in XAMPP.

2. **Open the Application:**
